/// MQTT protocol version enumeration
///
/// Represents the supported MQTT protocol versions. Each variant corresponds
/// to the protocol level value as defined in the MQTT specification.
/// This is used throughout the library to handle version-specific behavior
/// and feature availability.
///
/// # Protocol Level Values
///
/// The numeric values correspond to the Protocol Level field in the CONNECT packet:
/// - v3.1.1 uses protocol level 4
/// - v5.0 uses protocol level 5
/// - `Undetermined` is used by servers to accept any supported version
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```ignore
/// use mqtt_protocol_core::mqtt::version::Version;
///
/// // Client specifies a specific version
/// let client_version = Version::V5_0;
///
/// // Server accepts any supported version
/// let server_version = Version::Undetermined;
///
/// match server_version {
///     Version::V3_1_1 => println!("Using MQTT v3.1.1"),
///     Version::V5_0 => println!("Using MQTT v5.0"),
///     Version::Undetermined => println!("Waiting for client CONNECT to determine version"),
/// }
/// ```
