/// Retain Handling Option for MQTT Subscriptions
///
/// This enum defines how retained messages should be handled when establishing
/// a new subscription. It corresponds to bits 4-5 in the Subscription Options
/// byte as specified in the MQTT v5.0 protocol specification.
///
/// Retained messages are messages that the broker stores and delivers to new
/// subscribers immediately upon subscription. The retain handling option
/// controls this behavior, allowing subscribers to specify whether they want
/// to receive existing retained messages.
///
/// # Protocol Specification
///
/// The retain handling option is encoded in bits 4-5 of the Subscription Options:
/// - Bits 4-5: `00` = Send retained messages at subscribe
/// - Bits 4-5: `01` = Send retained messages only for new subscriptions  
/// - Bits 4-5: `10` = Do not send retained messages at subscribe
/// - Bits 4-5: `11` = Reserved (invalid)
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// - **SendRetained**: Useful when a subscriber always wants the latest retained value
/// - **SendRetainedIfNotExists**: Prevents duplicate retained messages on subscription renewal
/// - **DoNotSendRetained**: For subscribers that only want new messages
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```ignore
/// use mqtt_protocol_core::mqtt;
///
/// // Always receive retained messages when subscribing
/// let always_retained = mqtt::packet::RetainHandling::SendRetained;
///
/// // Only receive retained messages for new subscriptions
/// let new_only = mqtt::packet::RetainHandling::SendRetainedIfNotExists;
///
/// // Never receive retained messages
/// let no_retained = mqtt::packet::RetainHandling::DoNotSendRetained;
///
/// // Convert from byte value
/// let from_byte = mqtt::packet::RetainHandling::try_from(1u8).unwrap();
/// assert_eq!(from_byte, mqtt::packet::RetainHandling::SendRetainedIfNotExists);
/// ```

    /// same topic filter (even with different QoS), retained messages will not
    /// be sent again. This prevents duplicate delivery of retained messages.
    ///

    /// is established, regardless of whether matching retained messages exist.
    /// The subscriber will only receive newly published messages after the
    /// subscription is active.
